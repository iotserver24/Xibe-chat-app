## Restricted Capability: runFullTrust

### Why do you need the runFullTrust capability, and how will it be used in your product?

**Xibe Chat requires the `runFullTrust` capability because it is built using the Flutter framework, which compiles to native Win32 desktop applications rather than UWP apps. The application requires full trust access to provide essential functionality through native code execution and system-level integrations.**

**Specific Technical Requirements:**

1. **Flutter Framework Architecture:**
   - Xibe Chat is built with Flutter, which compiles Dart code to native C++ executables
   - Flutter applications on Windows are Win32 desktop applications, not UWP apps
   - The Flutter engine requires full trust to execute native code and access system resources
   - Native C++ code in `windows/runner/` uses Windows APIs directly (WinMain, COM initialization, window management)

2. **SQLite Database via Foreign Function Interface (FFI):**
   - The app uses `sqflite_common_ffi` package for local data storage
   - This package uses FFI to call native SQLite libraries (sqlite3.dll)
   - FFI requires full trust to load and execute native DLLs
   - All chat conversations, messages, and user data are stored locally in SQLite databases
   - This is essential for the app's core functionality of persistent chat storage

3. **Windows WebView2 Integration:**
   - The app uses `webview_windows` plugin for displaying web content
   - WebView2 requires native Windows APIs (COM interfaces, window handles, message loops)
   - Used for displaying CodeSandbox previews and Razorpay payment interfaces
   - Native WebView2 integration requires full trust to access system-level browser components

4. **Window Management:**
   - The app uses `window_manager` plugin for desktop window controls
   - Requires native Windows APIs for:
     - Window resizing and positioning
     - Window state management (minimize, maximize, restore)
     - Multi-monitor support
     - DPI awareness and scaling
   - Essential for providing a proper desktop application experience

5. **System Integration:**
   - Deep link handling requires registry access and protocol registration
   - File system access for storing local databases and preferences
   - Network access for API communications (already declared via `internetClient` capability)

**Use Cases:**
- **Local Data Storage**: SQLite database for storing chat history, messages, and user preferences locally on the device
- **Web Content Display**: Embedded WebView2 for previewing code execution results and processing payments securely
- **Desktop Experience**: Native window management for resizable windows, proper taskbar integration, and multi-monitor support
- **System Integration**: Deep link protocol handling for opening the app from external sources

**Security Considerations:**
- All user data is stored locally on the device - no cloud sync
- API keys are encrypted and stored securely
- Code execution happens in remote sandboxes (E2B), not locally
- The app does not access sensitive system areas beyond what's necessary for its functionality
- Source code is open source and available for security review: https://github.com/iotserver24/xibe-chat-app

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- UWP conversion is not feasible as Flutter does not support UWP compilation
- Removing FFI dependencies would eliminate local data storage, breaking core functionality
- WebView alternatives would not provide the native integration required for payment processing
- Window management alternatives would degrade the desktop user experience

**Conclusion:**
The `runFullTrust` capability is essential for Xibe Chat to function as a native Windows desktop application. Without it, the app cannot access native SQLite libraries for data storage, integrate with WebView2 for web content display, or provide proper window management. These features are core to the application's functionality and user experience.

### Quick Reference for runFullTrust Justification (Copy this):

**SHORT VERSION (Recommended for Microsoft Store form):**

```
Xibe Chat requires runFullTrust because it's built with Flutter, which compiles to native Win32 executables. Essential uses:

1. Flutter Framework: Native C++ code execution requires full trust.

2. SQLite via FFI: sqflite_common_ffi loads native SQLite DLLs (sqlite3.dll) for local chat storage - requires full trust.

3. WebView2: webview_windows plugin uses native Windows APIs for web content display (previews, payments) - requires full trust.

4. Window Management: window_manager uses native APIs for window controls, resizing, multi-monitor support - requires full trust.

5. System Integration: Deep links and local file storage require full trust.

All data stored locally. Open source: github.com/iotserver24/xibe-chat-app
```

**ULTRA-CONCISE VERSION (If character limit is very strict):**

```
Xibe Chat needs runFullTrust because Flutter compiles to native Win32 apps requiring full trust for: (1) Native C++ execution, (2) SQLite FFI (sqflite_common_ffi loads sqlite3.dll for local storage), (3) WebView2 native APIs (webview_windows for web content), (4) Window management APIs (window_manager for desktop controls), (5) System integration (deep links, file access). All data stored locally. Open source: github.com/iotserver24/xibe-chat-app
```

**MINIMAL VERSION (Absolute minimum - use only if others don't fit):**

```
Flutter app compiles to native Win32 requiring runFullTrust for: (1) Native C++ execution, (2) SQLite FFI (sqflite_common_ffi loads sqlite3.dll), (3) WebView2 APIs (webview_windows), (4) Window management (window_manager), (5) System integration. Local storage only. Open source: github.com/iotserver24/xibe-chat-app
